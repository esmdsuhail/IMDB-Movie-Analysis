### Project description 
This project aims to explore the IMDB movie dataset and understand what factors lead to a movie’s success, gauged by high ratings. Then analyze the data by looking at the correlation between ratings and other variables. Using the 5 why’s approach to dig deeper into any identified patterns, seeking to understand the underlying reasons. Finally, it presents a report that explains a cohesive story, using visualization and actionable insights for stakeholders in the movie industry.

### Data source 
The dataset of this project is provided in IMDB_Movie.csv format and later it was cleaned and restructured for the analysis according to the tasks in the project.

### Data analysis
1.	Analyze the distribution of movie genres and their impact on the IMDB score. Determine the most common genres of movies in the dataset.

The drama genre is the most preferred one among all genres with around 1868 movies and comedy, thriller and action lies next with more than 1000 movies.
Then, for each genre, calculate descriptive statistics (mean, median, mode, range, variance, standard deviation) of the IMDB scores

The romance genre stays at the top with an Average IMDB score of 7.3 and sci-fi with 7.1 lies next. We can also see that most of the genre has an average score of about 6.0 ratings

The film-noir genre is at the top in the median with 7.9 ratings and History genre is at the mode with a 7.7 rating and the documentary genre stays 2nd in both the median and mode of IMDB scores.

The genre from high to low is similar in both standard deviation and variance but the range is different as in deviation it’s from 1.3 - 0.3 and in variance it’s from 1.8 – 0.1



2.	Analyze the distribution of movie durations and its impact on the IMDB score.

The chart shows with the increase in the duration the rating also increases but reaching a certain limit it will stop and the range of duration lies between 104 – 124 minutes to get a rating of around 7 – 9 stars.


3.	Determine the most common languages used in movies and analyze their impact on the IMDB score using descriptive statistics (mean, median, and standard deviation).

The English language dominates the movies with over 96% and the rest of the languages of the top 10 Share is shown in the second pie chart

The mean and median look very similar in the language analysis but there is a lot of deviation in the languages according to the movies


4.	Identify the top directors based on their average IMDB score analyze their contribution to the success of movies and show the Influence of directors on movie ratings.

The top directors with 3 movies and an average score of above 7.0 star rating shown in the chart but the top 10 directors have with average rating of above 8.0 which means that their influence on the movie is more than the other directors.


5.	Explore the relationship between movie budgets and their financial success. Analyze the correlation between movie budgets and gross earnings

The combined chart of budget and the gross of movies also shows the top movies with the highest gross and in comparison, with its budget.
The top 3 highest-gross movies have a profit margin of around 70% but the next 2 movies have a profit margin of 98%.

It’s difficult to understand the relation between the movie budget and the gross returns but if we look at all top movies there is almost of 60% profit margin excluding the exceptional movies.
